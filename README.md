Any work in progress is out of the scope of the course as I have already passed the course/project with all the required components.  
_Current Work in Progress:_
- Load data into PowerBI 

# How to run the code:
Setup a connection to MySQL and PostgreSQL and verify their connections   
_Copy the schema.sql into DataGrip or MySQL Workbench and run it_  
then run the following command:  
__python load.py reports staff__   
Afterwards, verify that all tables have been created and imported to MySQL Workbench / DataGrip 
run the following command:  
__python transform.py__  
Verify that all tables have been created and imported to PostgreSQL, the tables should be made automatically.
